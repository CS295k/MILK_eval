The unparsed sentences are to be found in the directories p1, p2... p4.  Each
directory has files xaa, xab, etc, each with 5000 sentences. If you cat'ed all 
of these sentences together, you will have 502502 sentences.  
The file "instructions.txt" has 502,627 sentences.  The difference comes from removing
all "sentences" of length three characters or less --- e.g. "."  Many of these were
causing the parser to abort and none were really sentences.  (As opposed to some four
character sentences, such as "Mix.")

The directories p1p, ... p4p have are identical to p1, ... p4, except here the
files contain the corresponding parsed sentences.  That
is, the file p1p/xaa has the parsed versions of the sentences in p1/xaa.

The file all_parses.txt contains all of the parsed files concatenated together (get it? con'cat'tinated!).
