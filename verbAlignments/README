There is a file in this directory for each of the 260 MILK annotated recipes.  In each file
there is one line corresponding to each action sentence.  An "action sentence" is a sentence
who's corresponding milk commands contains at least one action predicate.  An action predicate
is any predicate except for the two "create" milk predicates.

For each action line there is the action predicate followed by the verb which the alighment
found to be verb which was most highly ranked as the verb alighned to that milk predicate.
If there is no verb which ranks highly, the predicate is associated with the dummy NOVERB .

For example, here is the file for the first recipe 1-Pot-3-Bean... which happens to be
remarkably accurate(<:

put NOVERB cook Heat combine NOVERB put NOVERB cook Heat 
separate NOVERB remove Remove leave set 
combine NOVERB cook Saute 
combine Add set cover cook simmer 
combine Add cook simmer serve NOVERB

The third action sentence has the following annotations:
<line><originaltext>Saute onions until soft, about 5 minutes. </originaltext><annotation>combine({ing2, ing20}, ing21, "onion in oil", "")</annotation></line>
<line><originaltext>Saute onions until soft, about 5 minutes. </originaltext><annotation>cook(ing21, t0, ing22, "onions in oil", "saute until soft, about 5 minutes")</annotation></line>

Note that the "combine" is implicit in the sentence, and the program correctly says that 
there is no verb that expresses this command.  On the other hand, the cook predicate is 
aligned with the verb "Saute".
