Each file in this directory contains the probabilities for stage 2 of our generative model.
As we have agreed, they are the product of 10-fold cross validation.  For example,
the recipie 1-Pot-3-Bean-Chicken-Stew was created when we used the n%mod10==0 since it
is the 0th recipe in alpabetical order.

Each file expresses possible partitions of the milk predicates into distinct
groups.  Since stage one may identify different groups of predicates as corresponding
to individual sentences, in stage 2 we give the possibility analysis for every
possible grouping, as identified by the numbers of the first, and last action milk 
predicate.  Thesse are expressed as

start end number-of-possibilities
      string-indicating-subgrouping  probability

e.g., 

0 1 1                     //start with milk statement #0, and with #1,  only 1 possible grouping
        B 1
0 2 2
        BB 0.780007
        CB 0.219993
0 3 4                     // there are 4 possible groupsings found for statements 0 to 4
        BBB 0.687105      // most prob is each Milk correspndes to different verb or noverb  at all
        CBB 0.193791
        BCB 0.0857762
        CCB 0.0333282


in the subgroupings B="break" C="continue"  That is the sub grouping BCB means that
the first Milk pred is by itself, the next-two are combined into 1 verb.  The last "B"
is just there so there is one letter for each Milk predicate to be grouped.
CCB means all three are grouped togenter into one verb (Not very liekly).
